      question: "How does ZeroToken work with different AI platforms?",

    {
      question: "What are handoff reports?",

    {
      question: "How does AI Detox work?",
      answer: "AI Detox analyzes your conversation history, identifies outdated or redundant context, and creates a condensed summary. This frees up memory space and helps the AI provide more focused, relevant responses."
    },
    {
      question: "Is my conversation data secure?",
      answer: "Yes, ZeroToken processes your conversations locally in your browser. We don't store or transmit your private conversations to our servers. Only anonymized usage analytics are collected to improve the product."
    },

      question: "Can I cancel my Pro subscription anytime?",
